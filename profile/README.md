# carbonCostKaggle

We are two data scientists, [Chrisanna Cornish](https://github.com/Xannadoo) and [Danielle Dequin](https://github.com/dmdequin) working together to evaluate the carbon footprint of data science competitions. Under the guidance of research professional [Veronika Chelpygina](https://github.com/vcheplygina) we are evaluating the energy consumption of kaggle competitions, starting with [SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-covid19-detection/data).
