# carbonCostKaggle

We are two data scientists, [Chrisanna Cornish](https://github.com/Xannadoo) and [Danielle Dequin](https://github.com/dmdequin) working together to evaluate the carbon footprint of data science competitions. Under the guidance of research professional [Veronika Chelpygina](https://github.com/vcheplygina) we are evaluating the energy consumption of kaggle competitions, starting with [SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-covid19-detection/data).

We measure the cost of training two models on seven datasets. The following are the links to the original repositories for the models and their respective datasets:
- [Second Place Team in the Competition](https://github.com/nvnnghia/siim2021)
- [revisiting-transfer by Juodelyte et al.](https://github.com/DovileDo/revisiting-transfer)

Within our organization you will find forks of the above repositories with any necessary changes we made to run the code locally and add [CarbonTracker](https://github.com/lfwa/carbontracker) to estimate the carbon footprint of training. The links to those forked repositories are:
- [Forked repo of the Second Place Team in the Competition](https://github.com/carbonCostKaggle/siim2021)
- [Forked repo of revisiting-transfer by Juodelyte et al.](https://github.com/carbonCostKaggle/revisiting-transfer)
